# Cybersecurity-Projects

These are projects I put together during my time as a Tier 1 SOC analyst intern. These projects consist of showing different types of attacks and how to identify them using security tools like Security Onion, Wireshark, Ntopng, and logs from various servers (Syslog, DHCP, DNS, and Proxy). My aim is to show my proficiency using security tools, intrusion detection skills, and remediation. I do not know everything, and I do have a lot to learn. These projects are good foundational building blocks in my IT career, and I hope to use these skills to help secure businesses in the future. Enjoy!
